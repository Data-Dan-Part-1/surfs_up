Oahu Surf Shop Analysis

After the analysis of precipation and temperature variance between June and December, it has been determined that December has significantly less precipitation with an average temperature of ~70 degrees. June can be expected to have a higher percentage of days that produces precipitation and we can expect less volume of consumers during this month. 

It is highly recommended that further analysis, comparable to the one conducted, be done for precipitation and temperature data throughout every month for further strategic decision making.
